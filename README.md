In this notebook, I delve into a raw dataset containing a comprehensive list of collectible cars from my father's extensive collection. The aim is to transparently document the journey of transforming this initial dataset into a cleaned and well-structured format. This transformation is crucial as it lays the groundwork for developing a smart inventory system. With this system, my father will be able to manage his collection more efficiently and effectively. The project is still in progress.
